# BowlingGame
This repository holds contains files for the bowling game.

The main file: bowlingGame.py contains all functions needed to play the bowling game described in the task - specifically:
bowlingGame.roll(noOfPins) and bowlingGame.score()

The second file: playGame.py allows testing of the bowling game with randomly generated roll sequences. 

You can use this code by typing : python3 playGame.py

The output file contains two test cases:
1. Test case #1 : full playing sequence - all 10 frames
2. Test case #2 : partial playing sequence - 17 rolls - to showcase the running score.
